## Intro

This is a little Discord Bot i made for me and my friends to show the current location of the ISS and stuff like the [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). It uses the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/) to get its data.

## Features

It has a little very minimal command set of Commands.
